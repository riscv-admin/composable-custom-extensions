# Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group Charter

Reuse of multiple custom extensions is rare, in part because extensions
may conflict in use of custom instructions and CSRs, and because there
is no common programming model or API for such extensions. This can lead
to disjoint solution silos and ecosystem fragmentation.

The TG will develop ISA and non-ISA specifications to facilitate the
decentralized, cooperative reuse of the custom instruction and custom
CSR space, enabling practical reuse, within a system, of multiple,
independently authored composable custom extensions (CXs), CX libraries,
and CX unit (CXU) modules, while also remaining backwards compatible
with legacy custom extensions.

New standard ISA extensions will enable multiple composable extensions
to coexist conflict-free within a system and enable an operating system
to uniformly support and secure stateful composable extensions.

Non-ISA *CX API* and *CX ABI* specifications provide a uniform
CX programming model (including CX naming, discovery, versioning,
state management, and error handling) and correct composition of CX
libraries. An optional *CXU logic interface* enables portable, modular
CXU hardware, and automatic composition of CPUs and CXUs into one system.

Overall, these specifications support *dependable composition* of CXs
and CX libraries, *decentralization* so that a CX may be defined without
involving other parties, and *stable binaries* so CX libraries compose
without adaptation. They apply *simple, fast, and frugal* mechanisms
appropriate across a *diversity* of RISC-V systems, from FPGA MCUs to
datacenter servers. They address *security* and *forward compatibility*
concerns.

## Acceptance criteria

A Proof-of-Concept will be developed with reference designs for all
components that are specified, demonstrating interoperation where merited.
The new standard ISA specifications will be accompanied by corresponding
SAIL and ACT tests.

## Exclusions

The CX TG is focused on the minimum set of standards *enabling*
practical composition of extensions, extensions software, and extensions
hardware. Other standards for infrastructure and tooling e.g. for CX
packages, debug, profile, formal specification of CX interface contracts,
CX library metadata, and tools, can be addressed in follow-on TGs.

## Collaborations
