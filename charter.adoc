# Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group Charter

Reuse of multiple custom extensions is rare, in part because extensions
may conflict in use of custom instructions and CSRs, and because there
is no common programming model or API for such extensions. This can lead
to disjoint solution silos and ecosystem fragmentation. To help address
this gap, the TG will advance interop standards that make it easier
to reuse custom extensions, enabling a plug-and-play ecosystem of such
extensions.

The TG will define ISA and non-ISA specifications to facilitate the
decentralized, cooperative reuse of the custom instruction and custom
CSR space, enabling practical reuse, within a system, of multiple,
independently authored composable custom extensions (CXs), CX libraries,
and CX unit (CXU) logic modules, while also remaining backwards compatible
with legacy custom extensions.

In particular the TG will define:

* criteria for a custom extension to be _composable_;

* ISA extensions that enable multiple composable extensions to coexist
  conflict-free within a system and enable an operating system to uniformly
  support and secure stateful composable extensions;

* non-ISA _CX API_ and _CX ABI_ specifications that provide a uniform
  CX programming model (including naming, discovery, versioning, state
  management, and error handling) and correct composition of CX libraries;

* an optional non-ISA _CXU logic interface_ specification that enables
  portable, modular CXU hardware, and automatic composition of CPUs and
  CXUs into one system.

Overall, these specifications support dependable composition of CXs
and CX libraries, decentralization so that a CX may be defined without
involving other parties, and stable binaries so that CX libraries
compose without adaptation. They apply simple, fast, and frugal
mechanisms appropriate across a diversity of RISC-V systems, from
FPGA MCUs to datacenter servers. They address security and forward
compatibility concerns.

## Acceptance criteria

A Proof-of-Concept will be developed with reference designs for all
components that are specified, demonstrating interoperation where deemed
necessary.

The extension package defined herein will be accompanied by corresponding
Sail support and ACT tests.

## Exclusions

The CX TG is focused on the minimum set of standards enabling practical
composition of extensions, extensions software, and extensions hardware.

## Collaborations

The CX TG governing committee is Privileged IC.

The CX TG may interact with: Unified Discovery TG, Platform Runtime
Services TG, SoftCPU SIG, Toolchains & Runtimes SIG, psABI.
