# Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group Charter

Reuse of multiple custom extensions is rare, in part because extensions
may conflict in use of custom instructions and CSRs, and because there
is no common programming model or API for discovering, using, and
managing such extensions. This leads to disjoint solution silos and
ecosystem fragmentation. This TG will fix this.

The TG will specify ISA extension(s) (CX ISA) plus interop interface
standards (CX API, CX ABI, and CX Unit logic interface (CXU-LI)) that
enable practical reuse, within a system, of multiple, independently
authored composable custom extensions (CXs), CX libraries, and CX unit
modules, remaining backwards compatible with legacy custom extensions.

* *CX ISA* extension(s) provide CX multiplexing, CX access control,
  and CX state context management.

  * *CX multiplexing* enables multiple CXs to coexist within a system,
    conflict free; software selects the hart’s CX and CX state context,
    prior to issuing that CX’s custom instructions and accessing its
    custom CSRs.
  
  * *CX access control* enables more privileged code to grant/deny less
    privileged code access to specific CXs and state contexts.
  
  * *CX state context management* enables a CX to have any number of
    CX state contexts and an OS to save, reload, and manage any CX state
    context.

* *CX API* provides CX libraries with a uniform CX programming model,
  including CX naming, discovery, versioning, state management, and
  error handling.

* *CX ABI* ensures correct nested library composition via disciplined
  management of CX multiplexing state and CX state context.

* *CXU logic interface* is an optional interop interface standard enabling
  reuse of modular CXU hardware via automated composition of a DAG of
  CPUs and CXUs into one system. With CXU-LI, each CXU implements one
  or more CXs, and, in response to a CX instruction, muxing delegates
  it to the selected CX/CXU.

The TG specifications should aim to balance these design tenets:

1. *Composability:* The behavior of a CX or CX library does not change
when used alongside other CXs.

2. *Decentralization:* Anyone may define or use a CX without coordination
with others, and without resort to a central authority.

3. *Stable binaries:* CX library *binaries* compose without rewriting,
recompilation or relinking.

4. *Composable hardware:* Adding a CXU to a system does not require
modification of other CPUs or CXUs.

5. *Frugality:* Prefer simpler induced hardware and shorter code paths.

6. *Security:* The specifications include a security assessment to
ensure composable extensions do not introduce extension or system
vulnerabilities, and do not facilitate new side channel attacks.

7. *Longevity:* The specifications incorporate mechanisms to improve
forwards compatibility with future composable extensions specifications.

## Acceptance criteria

Each deliverable must be implemented and proven in nontrivial interop
plug-fest scenarios involving multiple processors x extensions x extension
libraries x OSs.

REVIEW: SAIL, Spike, QEMU?

## Exclusions

Not every arbitrary custom extension can be a composable extension, so
the CX TG will specify which custom extensions are composable extensions.
Custom extensions that access only extension state and integer registers
are composable extensions, whereas other custom extensions that access
e.g., floating point registers, vector registers, shared memory, arbitrary
CSRs, etc., _may or may not be_ (yet to be determined).

The CX TG is focused on the minimum set of standards *enabling*
practical composition of extensions and software. Further standards
for infrastructure and tooling e.g. for CX packages, debug, profile,
formal specification of CX interface contracts, CX library metadata,
and tools, are _out of scope_.

## Collaborations

The CX TG governing committee is Privileged IC.

The CX framework will enable many ongoing and future unpriv extension
TGs to provide their extension as a composable extension. CX multiplexing
reduces the opcode and CSR impact of such extensions to zero, extending
the life of the 32b encodings. In addition, CX discovery and versioning
provides such extensions a uniform forwards compatible versioning story.
A modular CXU implementation would enable that extension in any
CXU-LI-compliant CPU cores.

The CX TG will interact with: Unified Discovery TG, Platform Runtime
Services TG, SoftCPU SIG, Toolchains & Runtimes SIG.

REVIEW: what about RISE, RVM-CSI SIG?

### Possible Overlaps

The CX TG will ensure its specification(s) harmonize and resolve overlaps
with the following TGs and specifications notwithstanding the objective
of routine, practical reuse of composable custom extensions.

* CX muxing ISA and CX state context management ISA may overlap Smstateen/Ssstateen

* CX muxing ISA's support for custom CSRs may overlap Smcrind/Sscrind

* CX API's CX discovery services may overlap

  * tech-config (Unified Discovery) to convey system config to machine mode

  * tech-prs (Platform Runtime Services) to convey system config to
    supervisor mode (devicetree, UEFI), SBI if necessary

* CX ABI may overlap

  * tech-psabi (ABI)

  * sig-toolchains for compiler ABI support, function attributes and/or
    intrinsics

## History

In 2019, the RISC-V Foundation FPGA soft processor SIG members, working
to advance RISC-V as the preeminent ecosystem for FPGA SoCs, committed to
"Propose extensions ... to enable interoperable RISC-V FPGA platforms and
applications". Members set out to define standards by which FPGAs'
extensible RISC-V cores might enable a marketplace of reusable custom
extensions and libraries. In 2019-2022, members met to define a
*minimum viable set* of interop interfaces, now the
[Draft Proposed RISC-V Composable Custom Extensions Specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grayresearch/CX/main/spec/spec.pdf),
proposed as a basis (reference) spec for CX TG.
