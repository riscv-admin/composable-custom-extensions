# Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group Charter

Reuse of multiple custom extensions is rare, in part because extensions
may conflict in use of custom instructions and CSRs, and because there
is no common programming model or API for such extensions. This can lead
to disjoint solution silos and ecosystem fragmentation.

The TG will develop ISA and non-ISA specifications to facilitate
the decentralized, cooperative reuse of the custom instruction and
CSR space, enabling practical reuse, within a system, of multiple,
independently authored composable custom extensions (CXs), CX libraries,
and CX unit (CXU) modules, remaining backwards compatible with legacy
custom extensions.

ISA extensions provide *CX multiplexing*, enabling multiple CXs to coexist
within a system, conflict free, *CX access control*, enabling privileged
code to grant/deny access to specific CXs and state contexts, and *CX
state context management*, enabling an OS to manage any CX state context.

Non-ISA *CX API* and *CX ABI* specifications provide a uniform CX
programming model, including CX naming, discovery, versioning, state
management, and error handling, and ensure correct nested CX library
composition. An optional *CXU logic interface* enables modular CXU
hardware and automated composition of a DAG of CPUs and CXUs into
one system.

Overall, these specifications support *dependable composition* of CXs
and CX libraries, *decentralization* so anyone may define a CX without
coordination with others, and *stable binaries* so CX libraries compose,
unchanged. They apply *simple, fast, and frugal* mechanisms appropriate
across the *diversity* of RISC-V systems. They address *security* and
*forwards compatibility* concerns.

## Acceptance criteria

A Proof-of-Concept will be developed with reference designs for all
components that are specified, demonstrating interoperation where merited.

## Exclusions

The CX TG is focused on the minimum set of standards *enabling* practical
composition of extensions and software. Other standards for infrastructure
and tooling e.g. for CX packages, debug, profile, formal specification of
CX interface contracts, CX library metadata, and tools, can be addressed
in follow-on TGs.

## Collaborations
