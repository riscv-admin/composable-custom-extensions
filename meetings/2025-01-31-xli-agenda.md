# Meeting Agenda 2025-01-31: CX TG ad hoc meeting: Extension Logic Interface Workshop

When/where: 2025-01-31 7a-10a PT, Zoom

This is an ad hoc 2-3 hour TG meeting "workshop" to survey various
RISC-V extension/coprocessor logic interfaces and their user communities.

## Purpose

The TG will create ISA and non-ISA specifications that enable practical
reuse, within a system, of multiple composable custom extensions (CXs),
CX libraries, and modular CX unit (CXU) hardware. The TG deliverables
include an optional logic interface spec. Previously (2019-2024) Soft
CPU SIG designed such an interface, CXU-LI. Now the CX TG will draft
a new extension logic interface spec, informed by this, and by other
RISC-V extension logic interfaces, to be discussed in this workshop.

The meeting will consist of a series of ~25 min talks (incl. Q&A). Each
talk will showcase one extension logic interface: its purpose,
highlights, signaling (channels, port maps), state model, kinds of
custom instructions supported, what architectural state (e.g., vector
registers) is accessible to extensions, any pipeline issues, and also,
the logic interfaceâ€™s current ecosystem, user community, CPU cores
that support it, and exemplary uses in industry.

## Meeting agenda (details TBD)

- Extension logic interface presentations: ROCC, CV-X-IF, SCAIE-V, CXU-LI (2 hours)
- Discussion (0-1 hours)
