- Meeting schedule

  Guy feels meeting schedule is inflexible.  Guy recommends running a
  new poll to select a new time.  Guy believes recent message to
  tech-chairs changes policy for scheduling meetings.

  Darius indicated that current meeting schedule developed based on
  constraints understood at the time.  If constraints have changed,
  can consider rescheduling meeting.  Darius will contact Rafeal to
  resolve question about policy.

  David voiced the opinion that it is worthwhile to try to reschedule
  to a better time if constraints have in fact changed.
