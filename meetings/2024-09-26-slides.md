## Disclosures

## Agenda

- Final charter review status
- Requirements discussion status
- Draft ratification plan
- Ad-hoc meeting recap (opcodes)

## Final charter review status

###

Reuse of multiple custom extensions is rare, in part because custom
extensions may conflict in use of custom instructions and CSRs, and
because there is no common programming model or API for custom
extensions. This can lead to disjoint solution silos and ecosystem
fragmentation. To help address this gap, the TG will advance interop
standards that make it easier to reuse certain kinds of custom
extensions, enabling a plug-and-play ecosystem of such extensions.

The TG will define a framework of ISA and non-ISA specifications that
together facilitate the decentralized, cooperative reuse of the custom
instruction and custom CSR space, enabling practical reuse, within a
system, of multiple, independently authored composable custom extensions
(CXs), CX libraries, and CX unit (CXU) logic modules, while also remaining
backwards compatible with legacy custom extensions.

###

- Please raise any issues soon

## Requirements discussion status

- Discussion on list
- Major topics of discussion
  - Extension state (one/many, hart state or not)
  - Opcodes (all custom opcodes or subset, one/multiple ranges)
  - Hotpluggable extensions
  - Logic interface capabilities

## Draft ratification plan

- Requirements → work breakdown structure → freeze date
- Work breakdown structure in repository, discussion to begin soon

## Ad-hoc meeting recap (opcodes)

- No consensus reached, no decisions made
- There was some question about opcode usage in existing legacy custom extensions
  - Which major custom opcodes are in use
  - How may opcodes are used by each custom extension
  - Might be worth a survey to collect data, if can be done in a timely fashion
- Requirements regarding handling legacy custom extensions may need to be refined
