## Agenda

- Ratification plan status
- Community building activities

## Ratification plan status

- Ratification plan requires task owners, specification freeze date
- Lacking owners for major items
  - Incomplete schedule prevents committing to freeze date
- Need more volunteers and owners to complete schedule and move
  forward with ratification plan presentation

## Community building activities

- Increase understanding of group to outsiders
- Encourage participation in group
- Potential activities
  - Extension Logic Interface Workshop
  - Custom Extensions Workshop
  - Other suggestions?

## Extension Logic Interface Workshop

- Sometime 10-17 Dec., 2-4 hours, TBD
- Showcase all your cool custom extensions hardware infrastructure
- All welcome, specific logic interface communities specifically
  invited
- ROCC, CV-X-IF & PULP, CXU-LI, SCAIE-V, VCIX, PCPI, CODAL?, ACE?, â€¦?
- Presentations cover history, design, signaling, state models, CPU
  implementations, extensions supported, ecosystems, future plans
- To compare/contrast various logic interface features, tradeoffs,
  ecosystems needs
- Raise visibility of common logic interfaces, common extension
  infrastructure, and extension reuse and interop, and of CX TG and
  CXU-LI

## (First annual?) Custom Extensions Workshop

- Jamboree of RISC-V custom extensions, 2-4 hours
- Showcase all your cool custom extensions
- Sometime mid to late January 2025, 2-4 hours, TBD
- All welcome, a few keynoters specifically invited
- Presentations cover problem space, approach, specific custom
  instructions & CSRs, state model, software enablement, benefits,
  drawbacks, future plans
- Inform CX TG of common needs of extensions, socialize notion of
  "composability criteria"
- Help establish a RISC-V custom extensions community per se, help
  community recognize their common needs
- Potential increased visibility in RVI, raising profile of CX TG and
  properly reframing it as an interop and ecosystem enabler, not just
  for FPGAs
