- Draft Charter Status
- Call for Chairs Status
- Future Meeting Time

  It was noted that time slots are a recommendation, not a
  requirement, and Friday is often open.

- Open Discussion

  - Guy: strive for charter that is sufficiently broad, general, flexible,
    to avoid difficult process of amending it later
  - Tim: CX specs should support frugal implementations on bare metal MCUs
  - Goran: CX specs should support fast (CXU and back in as few clock
    cycles as possible) and simple software support
  - Jan: perhaps restore deleted "fast and frugal" tenet?
  - Guy: ASIC adopters not necessarily interested in an FPGA interop logic interface
  - Tim: original purpose to address need for standards-based interop and
    reuse of custom instruction accelerators, and TG should achieve that
  - Jan: charter expects ISA extensions plural and non-ISA specs to be
    separate so relevant to simple MCUs and Linux OS scenarios
  - Jan: recommend charter explicitly mandates, per spec, security
    assessment, forwards compat assessment, and demonstrated interop of
    reference designs for all components that are specified
