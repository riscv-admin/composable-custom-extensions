  Jan suggested that proposals be analyzed in the context of specific
  use cases, considering the impact of that use case at all levels of
  a design in detail, in order to better understand the cost and
  impact of different approaches.

  Victor asked:
  If there is time after the main topics are discussed. Like to know

  Jan said it was based on a fork from an older basis specification.
  Some overlap, but does not support composability.
