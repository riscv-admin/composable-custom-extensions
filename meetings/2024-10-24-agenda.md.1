# Meeting Agenda 2024-10-14

- Trip report: CX TG highlights from 2024 RISC-V NA Summit (5)

- Walkthrough of the TG's work breakdown structure (schedule) [1] (25)

We will briefly discuss each proposed work item, esp. what that item
might entail, so that TG members better understand the breadth of the
specification development work that is anticipated.

To prep for Thu's meeting, please spend 10-15 mins reviewing [1] and by all
means please share any questions or comments here. 

Thank you,
Jan.
